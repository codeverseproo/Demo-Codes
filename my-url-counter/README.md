# URL Counter: State That Lives in the Address Bar

This is a minimal React project built with Vite and TypeScript demonstrating the **URL-as-State** pattern.

The core idea is to treat the browser's URL (specifically, query parameters) as the single source of truth for certain types of UI configuration state, rather than keeping it solely in component state or a global store.

This pattern enables:

* *   **Effortless State Persistence:** State survives page refreshes automatically.
*     
* *   **Deep Shareability:** You can share a URL and land on the exact same view configuration.
*     
* *   **Improved Testability:** Specific UI states can be easily accessed via direct links.
*     
* *   **Leveraging Browser History:** Back and forward buttons navigate through UI states.
*     

## How it Works

The application's counter value and an optional 'mode' are stored directly in the URL's query parameters (e.g., `/?count=10&mode=increment`).

* *   When the application loads or the URL changes, the `CounterPage` component reads the `count` and `mode` parameters from the URL using `useSearchParams`.
*     
* *   The UI (the displayed count and mode) is rendered based on these values read from the URL.
*     
* *   When the user clicks the Increment or Decrement buttons, the code calculates the new count and **updates the URL** using `setSearchParams`.
*     
* *   Updating the URL triggers a re-render (handled by `react-router-dom`), and the component reads the _new_ state from the URL, completing the cycle.
*     

Local component state (`useState`) is only used for purely transient UI concerns, like displaying a temporary validation warning if the URL parameter is invalid.

## Setup and Running Locally

1. 1.  **Clone the repository (or use the code you have):**
1.     
1.     ```
1.     # If starting from scratch with the provided code
1.     # Create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript
1.     npm create vite@latest my-url-counter --template react-ts
1.     cd my-url-counter
1.     ```
1.     
1. 2.  **Install dependencies:**
1.     
1.     ```
1.     npm install react-router-dom
1.     # If you used create-react-app initially, you might also need:
1.     # npm install @types/react-router-dom --save-dev
1.     ```
1.     
1. 3.  **Replace the core files:** Ensure your `src/index.tsx` (or `src/main.tsx`), `src/App.tsx`, and `src/CounterPage.tsx` files contain the code discussed, with `BrowserRouter` wrapping your `App` component in the entry file.
1.     
1. 4.  **Start the development server:**
1.     
1.     ```
1.     npm run dev
1.     # or if using create-react-app:
1.     # npm start
1.     ```
1.     
1. 5.  Open your browser to the address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173/` for Vite or `http://localhost:3000/` for Create React App).
1.     

Interact with the counter and watch the URL bar! Try manually changing the `?count=...` or `&mode=...` parameters in the URL and hitting Enter.

## Deployment

This is a standard React application and can be deployed like any other static site.

1. 1.  **Build the project:**
1.     
1.     ```
1.     npm run build
1.     ```
1.     
1.     This will create a `dist` folder (for Vite) or `build` folder (for Create React App) containing the optimized static files.
1.     
1. 2.  **Deploy the contents of the build folder:** You can deploy this folder to any static hosting service, such as:
1.     
1.     * *   Netlify
1.     *     
1.     * *   Vercel
1.     *     
1.     * *   GitHub Pages (requires specific configuration for React Router)
1.     *     
1.     * *   AWS S3 + CloudFront
1.     *     
1.     * *   Surge.sh
1.     *     
1.     
1.     Most services will automatically detect the build folder and deploy it.
1.     

## Useful Notes & Next Steps

* *   **URL Parameter Serialization:** For more complex data in the URL (arrays, objects, etc.), consider using a library like `qs` or a dedicated hook like `use-query-params` to handle serialization and deserialization robustly.
*     
* *   **Validation:** In a real app, you'd want more robust validation of URL parameters to handle unexpected or malicious input gracefully.
*     
* *   **Default Values:** Implement logic to only include URL parameters when they differ from the default value, keeping URLs cleaner.
*     
* *   **When NOT to use URL State:** Remember this pattern is best for _UI configuration_ state you'd want to share. Don't put sensitive data or massive datasets in the URL.
*     
* *   **Explore `use-query-params`:** This library builds on `useSearchParams` and provides type-safe hooks for different parameter types, simplifying the pattern for more complex applications.
*     

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding and implementing the URL-as-State pattern in your React applications. Happy coding!
